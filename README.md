geeko
=====

A completely frivolous Android app created during
[Hackweek 11](https://hackweek.suse.com/), inspired by the
openSUSE wallpaper.  See the vines growing before your eyes!
See Geeko happily sitting on the vines!  See your battery
drain if you turn the screen off while the app is active and
the rendering thread keeps running!
