geeko
=====

Android live wallpaper created during [Hackweek 11](https://hackweek.suse.com/),
inspired by the openSUSE desktop wallpaper.  See the vines growing before
your eyes!  See Geeko happily sitting on the vines!

An APK of version 1.0 is available for download
[here](https://github.com/tserong/geeko/wiki/geeko.apk), assuming you trust me, github and SSL.
